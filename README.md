A collection of random projects from the internet that I loved so much that I ended up creating them. The projects do not use any specific tool or language. It's all mixed up. This repo was created for fun side projects to take a break from main learning.

For more info regarding a specific project, navigate to that project's directory and check out its readme file.

Happy Coding!
