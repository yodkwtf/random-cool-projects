# Random Cool Projects ðŸš©

It consists a collection of some random cool projects created using a variety of technologies.

#### Disclaimer

The projects didn't seem big enough for their individual repo and so I combined all of them together in this one.

For more info regarding a specific project, navigate to that project's directory and check out its documentation in the readme file.

## Goals

The goal of this repo is create some unique projects using new technologies and libraries that I haven't work with before. It allows me to get familiar with new stacks every now and then and helps me improve my knowledge of external tools and libraries.

It also allows me to work on some fun side projects when I want to take a break from my main learning and working.
